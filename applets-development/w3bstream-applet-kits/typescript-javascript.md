# TypeScript/JavaScript

While TypeScript and JavaScript compilers do not directly target WebAssembly (WASM), **AssemblyScript** offers an excellent alternative.&#x20;

Serving as a TypeScript-like language designed exclusively for WebAssembly, AssemblyScript provides a great pathway for TypeScript and JavaScript developers to leverage the capabilities of W3bstream.

For more comprehensive details, please refer to the AssemblyScript Applet Kit documentation:
